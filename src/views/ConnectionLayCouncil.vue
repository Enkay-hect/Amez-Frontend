            <p class="font-serif text-xl">
                As servants of the Most High God, and disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ that are guided by the Holy Spirit, the vision of the Connectional Lay Council of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is to prepare the lay members of our denomination for a life of service in the Kingdom of God.

                    We will do this by:

                    Developing ourselves and others as Christian disciples;
                    Helping others to know, worship and follow Christ in spirit and in truth;
                    Collaborating and cooperating across organizational, institutional and denominational boundaries to minister to the masses.
                    Our motto “Come with us to Christ” is the impetus for implementing ministries that are positive in transforming people’s lives spiritually, socially and economically; in promoting fellowship with God and other believers, as well as those who are not saved. We affirm our belief that no one is too old, too young, too rich, too poor, too saved or even too lost to benefit from the ministries offered by the Lay Council.

                    Membership in the Lay Council is not a prerequisite to benefit from the Lay Council’s ministries. However, all laity in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church are strongly encouraged to catch the vision for Christian Leadership, Accountability, Stewardship and Christian Service so that, together, we might usher in the Kingdom of God through the A.M.E. Zion Church.
